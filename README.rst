README for Unique 0.1
=====================

Unique will be a system for uniquely storing ``normalize`` objects in
a unique B-Tree, with a backing store which records history and makes
it hard to tamper with: git.  It could be used as a basic key/value
store, given a suitably lax storage schema.  But its goal is to be a
useful first normal form (1NF) store.

This is currently in very early stages of development.  Please contact
the author or send pull requests if you want to get involved!
